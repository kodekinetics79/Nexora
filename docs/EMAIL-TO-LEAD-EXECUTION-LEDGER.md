## Phase Zero — baseline verified at `1e69acd0978911edf091754bd2eb6142b7ca68b8`

Run at that exact SHA, clean worktree, 11 commits ahead of base:

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Solution build | **0 errors** |
| Complete backend suite (incl. PostgreSQL via Testcontainers) | **Failed: 0, Passed: 4816, Total: 4816** (12m27s) |
| PostgreSQL-tagged subset | **Failed: 0, Passed: 447** (1m37s) |
| Frontend Vitest | **698 passed / 65 files** |
| `tsc --noEmit` | **exit 0** |
| Model drift | `No changes have been made to the model since the last migration.` |

The previously reported 4816 was measured at `244f4a9`. It has now been **re-measured at
`1e69acd`** and is current. Nothing was red; no repair was required before proceeding.

## The blocking defect (#12) — read this first

There are currently **two independent MIME traversals** that disagree:

* `EmailInquiryManifestPlanner` walks `message.BodyParts` with explicit candidate selection
  ([`EmailInquiryManifestPlanner.cs`](../Backend/ERP_RFQ_Automation/Ingestion/Assembly/EmailInquiryManifestPlanner.cs), the `candidates` line).
* `EmailIngestEnqueuer.EnqueueAsync` walks `message.Attachments`
  ([`EmailIngestEnqueuer.cs`](../Backend/ERP_RFQ_Automation/Ingestion/Triage/EmailIngestEnqueuer.cs)).

`Attachments` yields only entities whose `Content-Disposition` is `attachment`. An embedded
`message/rfc822` from Outlook or Gmail commonly has no disposition header, so it is **invisible
to the enqueuer and visible to the planner**. The two therefore produce different parts, in
different order, and would mint different `ComponentKey`s.

**Wiring them as they stand would make every message wait at the barrier forever for a
component that was never scheduled** — a total ingestion stall that renders as "processing" on
screen. That is worse than the defect being fixed, which is why the poller wiring was reverted
rather than completed.

Approved resolution (product owner, this program): collapse onto the planner as the only walk.

---

## Exact next task

**#12, continued.** Groundwork is committed and green. What remains is one bounded increment
that must land together, because deleting the walk breaks both callers at compile time:

1. **#12b — persist `ManifestVersion`.** Add `public int ManifestVersion { get; set; }` to
   `EmailInquiryAssembly`, `e.Property(x => x.ManifestVersion).HasDefaultValue(1);` to the model
   builder, and `ManifestVersion = manifest.ContractVersion,` in `EmailInquiryCaptureService`.
   Then regenerate the migration — the branch keeps ONE migration and it has never been applied:

   ```
   git checkout ae6a376 -- Backend/ERP_RFQ_Automation/MigrationsBaseline/ErpRfqAutomationContextModelSnapshot.cs
   rm Backend/ERP_RFQ_Automation/MigrationsBaseline/20260813134002_EmailInquiryAssembly*.cs
   cd Backend/ERP_RFQ_Automation && mv Migrations Migrations.tmp-hidden
   ../../scratchpad/ef.sh migrations add EmailInquiryAssembly --no-build
   mv Migrations.tmp-hidden Migrations
   ```

   **Then re-paste the RLS + grant + purge-policy SQL block** into the regenerated migration's
   `Up`/`Down` — it is NOT regenerated and its loss silently removes tenant isolation. Copy it
   verbatim from commit `5afe445` (`git show 5afe445 -- '*EmailInquiryAssembly.cs'`). It
   contains: `ENABLE`/`FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` + `nexora_tenant_isolation` on both tables;
   `GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ... TO nexora_tenant_app`; `GRANT USAGE ON SEQUENCE`
   (**never** `SELECT`/`UPDATE` — `PostgreSqlProductionDialectTests` enforces this globally);
   the `nexora_purge_app` grant + `nexora_tenant_purge` policy guarded on the role existing.

2. **#12 — replace the walk.** Rewrite `EmailIngestEnqueuer` as the thin adapter. The full
   drafted implementation is in this session's history; its shape:
   `ScheduleAsync(assembly, persistedComponents, plan, ingest, clientEmail, ingestion, triage,
   coordinator, logger, ct)` → verify via `EmailComponentManifestVerifier` FIRST and hold every
   non-terminal component on any mismatch; then iterate persisted rows by `Ordinal`, skipping
   `IsTerminal` and any row already carrying a job; schedule under the persisted `ComponentKey`;
   `DeriveBatchId` = SHA-256 over `"nexora:email-assembly-batch:v1:{assemblyId}:{messageKey}"`.
   Delete `EnqueueAsync` and the `foreach (var att in message.Attachments)` loop outright.

3. **Update both callers** — `Services/EmailService.cs:913` and
   `Ingestion/Triage/EmailTriageService.cs:240`. Both must obtain the assembly + persisted
   components + plan from `IEmailInquiryCaptureService`, then call `ScheduleAsync`. The manual
   reprocess path must use the SAME coordinator and must not reopen an absorbing terminal
   assembly.

4. **Rewrite `EmailIngestEnqueuerTests`** — it asserts the walk being deleted.

5. **Add direct `EmailComponentManifestVerifier` tests** (#12c has none): each mismatch kind,
   and the case where skipped/ignored components carry no hash or size and must NOT be reported
   as mismatched.

Acknowledgement semantics stay as they are until #13; do not claim `SafeToAcknowledge` yet.

Verify with:

```
cd Backend && dotnet build ERP_RFQ_Automation.sln -v q --nologo
dotnet test ERP_RFQ_Automation.Tests/ERP_RFQ_Automation.Tests.csproj \
  --filter "FullyQualifiedName~EmailInquiry|FullyQualifiedName~EmailIngestEnqueuer|FullyQualifiedName~EmailTriage" --nologo
dotnet test ERP_RFQ_Automation.Tests/ERP_RFQ_Automation.Tests.csproj --nologo -v q
```

## Standing constraints

* One canonical planner, one persisted manifest, one durable scheduler, one barrier, one Lead
  identity path (`ILeadIdentityApplicationService`). No second implementation of any of these.
* No `dependency = null!` production constructor defaults, no service-locator, no swallowed
  exceptions, no dead legacy path, no unused flags, no source-text tests posing as behavioural.
* Retention (agreed): 1/7/30/90/180/365 days, default 7; clock starts only after a terminal
  outcome with structured data committed; never purge `NeedsReview` or `FailedRecoverable`.
* Credentials are entered only through the application's encrypted secret mechanism. Never in
  chat, code, tests, commits, screenshots or logs.
* Do not merge, deploy, amend published commits, or start Phase 3 / RFQ participation.

## Independent SME review — exact SHA `c61f73cb7ba0e5dd0d3d75cc7f4c7f1c74733e90`

Five bounded reviews commissioned against this SHA. Reviewers ran as separate read-only agents
with **no edit capability** — the "reviewers may not edit production files" rule is enforced by
tooling, not by instruction. Findings are recorded verbatim in substance; none is backfilled onto
earlier commits, and no approval is recorded for work that was not reviewed.

Critical and High block requirement #12.

### SME5 — Principal SDET (test architecture). Status: RETURNED, 8 findings

| ID | Sev | Summary | Disposition |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| F1 | **Critical** | `EmailInquiryCaptureService` has ZERO tests. `SafeToMarkSeen` — the single flag deciding whether a mailbox message is flagged `\Seen` — is unproven on all four of its return paths. | ACCEPTED |
| F2 | **Critical** | `EmailComponentManifestVerifier` has zero tests **and zero production callers**. The empty-hash exemption and the version short-circuit are unasserted. | ACCEPTED |
| F3 | **High** | `EmailInquiryAssemblyCoordinator.RecordComponentQueuedAsync` assigns `ExtractionJobId` **before** the terminal guard, so a replayed enqueue re-points an already-`Completed` component at a newer job id. | ACCEPTED — real defect |
| F4 | **High** | The source-regex test in `MailboxLoginIdentityTests` does not pin the invariant it claims: its whitelist admits bare `config.EmailAddress`, so rewriting **both** IMAP sites to bypass the resolver keeps it green. | ACCEPTED — my test was weaker than claimed |
| F5 | **High** | Poller and manual reprocess compute body text with **two different extractors** (`EmailBodyNormalizer` vs `EmailTriageService.GetBodyText`), so the shared enqueuer does not prevent drift — the *input* diverges. `ReprocessAsync` also reads `RawEmailPath` directly, ignoring `IRawEmailEvidenceReader`. | ACCEPTED |
| F6 | Medium | The "reason names no infrastructure detail" tests assert against hard-coded literals with no interpolation — they can never fail. The real leak surface (caller-supplied `reasonDetail` persisted by the coordinator) is untested. | ACCEPTED — security theatre in my own tests |
| F7 | Medium | `Attachment_only_inquiry_is_ready…` is byte-identical to the body-only test; `Evaluate` has no notion of component kind, so the distinction cannot exist at that layer. False coverage credit. | ACCEPTED |
| F8 | Medium | No test exercises capture → schedule → assemble together. Nothing asserts the planner's `ComponentKey` is the same string the consumer looks up, so the two can drift into total silent loss. | ACCEPTED |

**Consequence for #12:** F1, F2 and F3 must close inside #12b/#12c. F3 is a code fix, not a test
gap. F4/F5 move to #19 and #12d respectively. F6/F7 are test-quality corrections to work already
landed and are scheduled with #12b.
